appvm
=====

*appvm* is the thin easy-to-use hypervisor-based sandboxing software.

*appvm* was created for the purpose of decreasing complexity of using
graphical software inside virtual machines, at the same time
maintaining reasonable security and keep *appvm* itself simple and
portable.

While I'm trying to keep that documentation up-to-date, there may be
some missing information. Use ``appvm --help-long`` for checking all
features.

If you found anything missed here, please make a pull request or send
patches to patch@dumpstack.io.

If you need personal support, your company is interested in the
project or you just want to share some thoughts -- feel free to create
a new issue or write to root@dumpstack.io.
